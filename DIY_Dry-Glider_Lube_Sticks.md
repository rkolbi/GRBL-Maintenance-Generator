# DIY "Dry-Glider" Lube Sticks: The Grease-Free Solution for Dusty Gear Racks

If you operate a CNC machine or heavy equipment in a woodshop, you know the “Grease Trap” problem all too well: **oil and grease attract dust.**

When sawdust mixes with standard grease on a gear rack, it forms an abrasive paste—essentially a grinding compound that slowly wears down your pinion gears and racks every time the machine moves.

**The solution?** A custom-made, dry-wax lubricant stick.

Many traditional recipes use graphite, but we’ve upgraded ours with PTFE (Teflon). This keeps the sticks **non-conductive** (safe for CNC electronics) and prevents **galvanic corrosion** on aluminum rails.

Here’s a complete guide to making high-performance, dust-resistant lubricant sticks for roughly $6.50 each.

## Why This Recipe Works

This isn’t just “candle wax.” It’s a carefully engineered blend designed specifically for linear motion systems.

**1. The Base: Paraffin + Microcrystalline Wax**

- **Paraffin:** Provides slickness and transfers easily to metal.
- **Microcrystalline Wax:** Acts as a plasticizer. It gives the stick enough tack to cling to vertical racks without flaking, and prevents shattering if dropped.

**2. The Lubricant: PTFE Powder**

- **Why not Graphite?** Graphite is conductive and can float into stepper drivers or power supplies, causing shorts.
- **Why PTFE?** It creates a chemically inert, non-conductive, super-slick white film that **repels dust entirely**.

## Materials & Cost

*Yields: Six 1" × 1" × 5" sticks*

**Ingredients:**

- **Paraffin + Microcrystalline Wax:** ~$25 (1 lb paraffin + ~3 oz microcrystalline)
- **PTFE (Teflon) Powder:** ~$15 (1.75 oz / 50 g, micronized 1.6–3 μm)

**Tools:**

- Double boiler (or metal bowl over pot of water)
- Silicone mold (1" × 1" × 5" ideal)
- Stirring stick (disposable)
- Safety gear: dust mask (essential for PTFE handling)

**Total initial investment:** ~$40
 **Cost per stick:** ~$6.65 (with leftover wax for next batch)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Melt the Waxes

1. Set up your double boiler. **Never melt wax directly over an open flame—it’s flammable.**
2. Break up **1 lb paraffin** and place it in the top pot.
3. Melt completely, then add **2.5–3 oz microcrystalline wax**.
4. Stir gently until fully blended. Keep the heat moderate—the wax should never smoke.

### Step 2: Add the PTFE

- **Safety first:** Wear a dust mask. PTFE powder is extremely fine and should not be inhaled.
- Reduce heat so the wax is liquid but not bubbling.
- Gradually stir in **1.75 oz (50 g) PTFE powder**.
- Stir constantly to break up clumps. The mixture should turn a uniform **milky white**.

### Step 3: Cast the Sticks

1. Ensure silicone molds are clean and dry.
2. Pour the mixture slowly to avoid splashes.
3. Tap or gently shake the mold to release trapped air bubbles.
4. **Cool naturally** at room temperature for 1–2 hours. Avoid the freezer; rapid cooling can crack the wax.

### Step 4: Demold and Store

- Pop out the sticks. They should feel **hard but slightly waxy** (not brittle like a candle).
- Store in a Ziploc bag to keep them clean until use.

## How to Apply to Your Machine

1. **Clean the rack:** Use compressed air and a dry brush to remove all old grease, sawdust, and chips.
2. **Rub it on:** Use the stick like a crayon on the gear teeth and rack face.
3. **Distribute:** Run the machine back and forth to mash the wax into the rack valleys.
4. **Check visually:** You’ll see a faint, semi-transparent whitish film—no black grease mess.

## Maintenance & Troubleshooting

- **Reapply monthly:** If the rack feels dry or gear noise increases, give it a rub.
- **Stick too brittle?** Add more microcrystalline wax, remelt, and recast.
- **Stick too soft?** Add more paraffin, remelt, and recast.

By following this method, you break the destructive cycle of **“grease + dust = grinding paste”**, extending your machine’s drivetrain life significantly.
