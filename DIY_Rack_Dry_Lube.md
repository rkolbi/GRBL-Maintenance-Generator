## Why This Recipe Works for Your Setup

Your gear rack is in a **dusty wood-chip environment**, which makes oil and grease a liability:

- They attract and trap dust  
- Dust turns greasy lubricant into abrasive paste  
- Binding and wear increase over time  

A **dry wax + graphite lubricant stick** solves this by:

- Staying **dry and non-tacky**  
- Providing a clean lubricating film  
- Minimizing dust adhesion  
- Spreading evenly along gear teeth  
- Allowing fast reapplication without cleaning solvents  

The two-wax system ensures the right balance of hardness, flexibility, and film transfer.

## Final Recipe & Stick Size

You will produce **six** solid sticks sized **1″ × 1″ × 5″**.

### **Ingredients**

- **Paraffin wax:** 16 oz (all 1 lb from the set)  
- **Microcrystalline wax:** 2.5–3 oz  
- **Graphite powder:** full 2 oz bottle (~15% by weight of total wax)

### Why these ratios work

- Paraffin transfers to metal easily  
- Microcrystalline wax toughens the stick and prevents brittleness  
- Graphite supplies the actual lubrication  

You’ll still have ~13 oz of microcrystalline wax left for future batches.

## Step-by-Step How-To

### **Step 1: Melt the waxes**

1. Break paraffin and microcrystalline wax into smaller chunks.  
2. Use a **double boiler** (never melt wax directly over a flame).  
3. Melt the **16 oz paraffin** completely.  
4. Add **2.5–3 oz microcrystalline wax** and stir until fully blended.  
5. Keep heat moderate—wax should **never smoke**.

### **Step 2: Add the graphite**

1. Reduce heat to maintain a stable liquid without bubbling.  
2. Gradually stir in **all 2 oz** of graphite powder.  
3. Scrape the bottom as graphite tends to settle.  
4. Stir until the mixture is uniform and deep gray.

### **Step 3: Pour into molds**

1. Prepare molds sized **1″ × 1″ × 5″** (silicone preferred).  
2. Pour slowly to avoid splashing.  
3. Tap or gently shake the mold to release air bubbles.  
4. Let cool for **1–2 hours** at room temperature.

---

### **Step 4: Remove & store**

1. Pop each solid stick out of its mold.  
2. Store in a dust-free container or resealable bag.  
3. Label with date and “Graphite Dry Lube Stick” if desired.

---

### **Step 5: Apply to your gear rack**

1. Clean the rack: blow off chips and dust.  
2. Rub the stick directly along the **gear teeth and pinion contact face**.  
3. Move the pinion back and forth to distribute the coating.  
4. Reapply when the gray lubricating film begins to fade or friction increases.

For a 5-foot rack, one stick lasts a **very long time**.

## Maintenance Tips

- **Check monthly:** a quick rub restores full lubrication.  
- **If the stick is too soft:** increase microcrystalline wax slightly next batch (3–3.5 oz).  
- **If too hard or difficult to transfer:** reduce microcrystalline wax or slightly increase graphite.  
- **Avoid grease entirely:** dust will pack into it immediately in a woodshop environment.

## Final Thoughts

This recipe gives you a **clean, dust-resistant, long-lasting dry lubricant** specifically matched to the realities of a woodworking gear-rack system.  

With only **$33 of materials**, you produce six professional-quality lubricant sticks that outperform most commercial options and completely avoid the dust-gumming issues of traditional grease or oil.
